        We'll conclude the course by learning about basic programming concepts using Python, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, functions, and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. 
        
        We'll also learn how to make your programs interactive and how to test your code safely before adding it to a project. It is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.10+ that will have you writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time.

Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

In a multi-device world, people don't want to spend their life fussing with technology. An ambient approach gets the tech out of your way so you can live your life while getting the help you need. It doesn't matter what device you're using, what context you're in, whether you're talking, typing, or tapping. The technology in your life works together seamlessly. Ambient computing uses all aspects of modern-day technology, including voice assistants, artificial intelligence, sensors, connectivity, cloud computing and more.If you were thinking that the IoT and ambient computing sound a lot alike, you aren't wrong; the two concepts are intertwined. IoT refers to the vast array of devices that connect to the internet to optimize their functionality, like smart sensors and smart speakers: ambient computing builds on that. Ambient computing focuses on the interaction between these devices once they are connected.Matter, the next-generation smart home standard, solves many smart home pain points while bringing all our IoT devices together. Some of the biggest tech companies are working together to make Matter a unified protocol for future smart homes. These companies include Apple, Amazon, and Google. This means Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Google Nest, and Samsung SmartThings will support the Matter standard by default for all new devices.In this course we will learn to build smart homes with Amazon Alexa and Matter protocol.",
