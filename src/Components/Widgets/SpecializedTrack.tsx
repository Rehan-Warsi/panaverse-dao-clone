This is only achievable with open web-based metaverses. The internet and its browsers are magical. Federated but linked experiences connect pages, people, technology, businesses, standards, and nations. It's unlike anything else. The metaverse should replicate the best qualities of the web - it should just be the web. We just have to extend online responsive design from mobile to desktop to 3D, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality.

The AI and Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will aid in your comprehension of deep learning's potential, difficulties, and effects as well as equip you to take part in the creation of cutting-edge AI technology. \n 
        
        We will start this course by understanding the fundamentals and use cases for AI and move on to building next-gen intelligent apps using OpenAIâ€™s powerful models and Next.js 13. 
        
        We'll conclude the course by learning about basic programming concepts using Python, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, functions, and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. 
        
        We'll also learn how to make your programs interactive and how to test your code safely before adding it to a project. It is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.10+ that will have you writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time. 
        
        In this quarter we will also learn Git, the distributed version control system. We will also review Git-based GitHub services.`,
